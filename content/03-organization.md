## Organizations

Organizations in the Cadasta Platform represent organizations in real life. The Cadasta API allows you to work with data associated with organizations that have been added to the platform, and to add organizations as well. The endpoints for these objects start with `api/v1/organizations`.

_To learn more about organizations, <a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/02-organizations.html" target="_blank">see our documentation on Organizations</a>._

### List Organizations using a permissions filter

```endpoint

If you want to list only organizations where the user can create projects, you request:

```

To filter against more than one permission, provide a comma-separated list of these permissions.

```
GET /api/v1/organizations/?permissions=project.create,org.update
```

Organizations can be filtered using the following permissions:
