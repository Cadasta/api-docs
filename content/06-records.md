## Spatial Units (a.k.a Project Locations)


Projects in the Cadasta Platform are spatial in nature â€“ collections of points, lines, and polygons representing areas where land rights documentation is happening. These points, lines, and polygons can be retrieved and modified using the Cadasta API.

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#project-locations" target="_blank">Read more about Project Locations in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The endpoint you need to access JSON for spatial units / project locations starts like this: `/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/`


### Spatial Unit JSON Object

A spatial unit / project location JSON object is a [GEOJSON object](http://geojson.org/) contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`type` | `String` | This field is automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` | A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries" target="_blank"> GeoJSON representation</a> of the spatial unit's geometry.
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID, defines the type of location it is (land `types`), and lists any attributes. (See  the `properties` table below for more information)

The `properties` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` |  A unique ID for the spatial unit
`type` | `String` | The type of spatial unit that it is, defined by the fields in your questionnaire. (See the land `types` table below )
`attributes` | `Object` | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the projects questionnaire.

**Land `type` Abbreviations**

If you need to plot out the land `types`, these are the abbreviations you need:

Abbreviation | What it Represents
--- | ---
`PA` | Parcel
`CB` | Community Boundary
`BU` | Building
`AP` | Apartment
`PX` | Project Extent
`RW` | Right-of-way
`NP` | National Park Boundary
`MI` | Miscellaneous

## Relationships

Each location has a relationship with one or more parties, and each of those parties has a specific type of relationship with the land. For example, a municipal body may own a park, and a local tribe may have right-of-way access to it. Ownership and right-of-way-access are both types of relationships. (Note that sometimes you may also see the word "tenure" in lieu of or alongside the word "relationship.")

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#location-relationships" target="_blank">Read more about Relationships in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The Cadasta API allows you to list relationships of a party and list relationships to a spatial unit / project location. You can also get, create, update, and delete relationships as well.

Endpoints in this section start with:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/{party_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/relationships/tenure/{relationship_id}/
```

### Relationship JSON object

A relationship object contains the following properties:


Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`rel_class`| `String` | The type of relationships; currently `"tenure"` is the only possible relationship type.
`id` | `String`  | The unique ID of the relationship
`party` | `Array` | The object containing the party that the spatial unit is related to. (See the `party` table below for more information.)
`spatial_unit` | `Object` | The spatial unit / project location object. (See the `spatial unit` table below for more information.)
`tenure_type`| `String` |  The kind of relationship. (See the Relationship (Tenure) Categories table for more information.)
`attributes`| `Object`  | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the project's questionnaire.

The `party` object has the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `String` | The unique ID of the party.
`name` | `String` | The name of the party.
`type` | `String` |  The type of party, e.g. an individual (`IN`), a group (`GR`), or a corporation (`CO`).

The `spatial_unit` object has the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`type` | `String` | Type of spatial unit; automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` |  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries" target="_blank"> GeoJSON representation</a> of the spatial unit's geometry.
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID and defines the type of location it is (land `types`). (See  the `properties` table below for more information)
