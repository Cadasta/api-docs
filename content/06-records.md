## Spatial Units (a.k.a Project Locations)

> Questions for Oliver:
* Should we call these Spatial Units or Project Locations? They're called Project Locations in the docs and on the platform, so I'm inclined to go that route. Are they called Spatial Units for a reason?


Projects in the Cadasta Platform are spatial in nature â€“ collections of points, lines, and polygons representing areas where land rights documentation is happening. These points, lines, and polygons can be retrieved and modified using the Cadasta API.  

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#project-locations" target="_blank">Read more about Project Locations in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The endpoint you need to access JSON for spatial units / project locations starts like this:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/
```
> Oliver, is `geometry` an `array` or an `object`? Used `array` since `object` wasn't listed as a type literal. (this is true for all instances in this doc.)

A spatial unit / project location JSON object contains the following properties: 

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`type` | `String` | x | This field is automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Array` | x | An object defining whether the location is recorded as a point, line, or polygon, as well as coordinates that make it up. (See the `geometry` table below for more information.)   
`properties` | `Array` | x | An object that gives the location a unique ID, defines the type of location it is (land `types`), and lists any attributes. (See  the `properties` table below for more information)

The `geometry` object contains the following properties: 

> Oliver, is `coordinates` an `Array` if it's only a single point?

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`type` |  `String` | x | Indicates the geometry type: a `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon`.
`coordinates` | `Array` | x | An array of all the GPS coordinates that make up the geometry of the spatial unit.

The `properties` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`id` | `String` | x |  A unique ID for the spatial unit
`type` | `String` | x | The type of spatial unit that it is, defined by the fields in your questionnaire. (See the land `types` table below )
`attributes` | `Array` |  | An array of different attributes for the property. 
`project` | `Array` |  | An object containing basic information about the project, and within that, the organization. This field will not be present when working with a list of spatial units, as with `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/`. See the `project` table below for more information.

> Oliver, `attributes` looks like an object, but I don't see any listed as an example. How are these objects structured? 

The `project` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`id` | `String` | x |  A unique ID for the project
`organization` | `Array` | x |  An object containing the organization `id`, `slug` and `name`. (See the `organization` table below.)
`name` | `String` | x |  The name of the project that the spatial unit is a project. 
`slug` | `String` | x |  The project slug.

Finally, the `organization` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`id` | `String` | x |  A unique ID for the organization.
`slug` | `String` | x |  The organization slug.
`name` | `String` | x |  The name of the organization that's housing the project. 

**Land `type` Abbreviations**

If you need to plot out the land `types`, these are the abbreviations you need:

Abbreviation | What it Represents
--- | ---
`PA` | Parcel
`CB` | Community Boundary
`BU` | Building
`AP` | Apartment
`PX` | Project Extent
`RW` | Right-of-way
`NP` | National Park Boundary
`MI` | Miscellaneous

### Create a New Spatial Unit / Project Location


```endpoint
POST /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/
```

Use the above method to create a new spatial unit / project location.

**Request Payload**

Property | Type | Required? | Description 
--- | --- | :---: | --- 
`geometry` | `Array` | x | An object defining whether the location is recorded as a `Point`, `Line`, or `Polygon`, as well as coordinates that make it up. (See the `geometry` table above for more information.) 
`type` | `String` | x | This refers to the possible land `types` that the location could be (e.g. `PA` = Parcel). See the **Land `type` Abbreviations**  table above for more information.
`attributes` | `Array` |  | An array of different attributes for the property. 

Formatting your geometry can be a little tricky. Here are some examples to help you out. 

To format a **point**, write something like::

```json
geometry: {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.7457809448242, 45.64344809984393]}
```
> Oliver, is `LineString` the correct thing to use here? `Line` didn't work, but in the GeoJSON docs I found LineString

To format a **line**, write something like:

```json
"geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [-122.7457809448242, 45.64344809984393 ], [-122.7457809448235, 45.64344809984393 ], [-122.7457809448219, 45.64344809984393 ] ] }
```

To format a **polygon**, write something like:

```json
"geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [-122.7457809448242, 45.64344809984393 ], [-122.7457809448235, 45.64344809984442 ], [-122.7457809448219, 45.64344809984999 ], [-122.7457809448242, 45.64344809984393 ] ] ] }

```

For polygons, make sure that the last coordinate is the same as the first.

Note that the main difference between the formatting examples above is the number of brackets, and the selection of `Point`, `LineString` or `Polygon` as the `type`.


**Response**

The response is a complete [spatial unit / project location JSON Object](#user-content-example-spatial-unit--project-location-json-object).

####Example Response

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {

            45.64344809984393
        ]
    },
    "properties": {
        "id": "n776cwdhqriaqdwsfafiajib",
        "type": "MI",
        "attributes": {},

            },
            "name": "Portland Project",
            "slug": "global-project"
        }
    }
}

### Delete a Spatial Unit / Project Location

```endpoint
DELETE /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/
```

Use the above method to delete a spatial unit / project location.

Pressing the **Delete** button from the API UI will delete the member.
**URL Parameters**

URL Parameter | Description
---|---
`organization_slug` | The slug provided for the organization, which can be found by locating the organization in the [list of all organzations](03-organization.md#user-content-list-organizations)
`project_slug` | The slug provided for the project, which can be found by [listing all of the projects in an organization](04-project.md#user-content-list-all-projects).
`spatial_unit_id` | The  uniqe ID of the spatial unit, which you can find by [listing all of the spatial units](#user-content-list-spatial-units--project-locations) for the project it's in. 

**Response**

> Oliver, not sure if this is what's supposed to happen, but this is what happened.

If the deletion has properly occurred, then you should get a message like the following:

```
NOT FOUND

The requested URL /api/v1/organizations/example-organization/projects/global-project/spatial/w4rwh32mqctn9g223wnry2gx/ was not found on this server.
```

When you [list all the spatial units in the project](#user-content-list-spatial-units--project-locations), the one you've just deleted should be gone.

Otherwise, you'll get an error message or one of these [common response codes](01-introduction.md#user-content-common-response-codes).

####Example Response

## Parties

Each project location has a relationship with people of all kinds â€“Â sometimes individuals, sometimes groups, and sometimes a corporation. These people are known as **parties** in the Cadasta system. 

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#location-relationships" target="_blank">Read more about Parties in our Platform Documentation</a>_

Using the API, you can view, create, update, and delete parties for your project. 

The endpoint for parties begins like this:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/
```

_These methods requires using both an organization and a project slug. [Click here to learn about finding and formatting slugs](01-introduction.md#slugs)._

A party JSON object contains the following properties:

> Oliver
* see `attributes` below - what goes in there?
* how are `contacts` supposed to be formatted? Is it like contacts for an organization?

Property | Type | Required? | Description 
--- | --- | :---: | --- 
`id` | `String` | x | The autogenerated unique ID for each party.
`name` | `String` | x | The name of the party.
`type` | `String` | x | The type of party, indicating whether it's an individual (`IN`), a group (`GR`), or a corporation (`CO`).
`contacts` | `Array` |  | An array containing party contact information.
`attributes` | `Array` |  | ??
`project` | `Array` |  | A field with the project `id`, `name`, `slug`, and `organization`, which is itself an array including the organization `id`, `slug`, and `name`. (See the `project` and `organization` tables below for more information.) Note that this property will not appear in all responses. 

The `project` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`id` | `String` | x |  A unique ID for the project
`organization` | `Array` | x |  An object containing the organization `id`, `slug` and `name`. (See the `organization` table below.)
`name` | `String` | x |  The name of the project that the spatial unit is a project. 
`slug` | `String` | x |  The project slug.

Finally, the `organization` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|:---:|---
`id` | `String` | x |  A unique ID for the organization.
`slug` | `String` | x |  The organization slug.
`name` | `String` | x |  The name of the organization that's housing the project.

## Relationships

> Oliver, there are quite a few errors / gaps in this section. Will need your help to fill it in.

Each location has a relationship with one or more parties, and each of those parties has a specific type of relationship with the land. For example, a municipal body may own a park, and a local tribe may have right-of-way access to it. Ownership and right-of-way-access are both types of relationships. (Note that sometimes you may also see the word "tenure" in lieu of or alongside the word "relationship.")

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#location-relationships" target="_blank">Read more about Relationships in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The Cadasta API allows you to list relationships of a party and list relationships to a spatial unit / project location. You can also get, create, update, and delete tenure relationships as well.

Endpoints in this section start with:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/{party_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/relationships/tenure/{relationship_id}/
```

_These methods require using both an organization and a project slug. [Click here to learn about finding and formatting slugs](01-introduction.md#slugs)._

A relationship object contains the following properties:

> Fill in when I can see the relationship object

####Example Relationship JSON Object

> Fill in when I can see / access the relationship object.


###Relationship (Tenure) Categories

Relationships fall into one of the following categories. The abbreviations on the left are what you'd use when modifying or reading a tenure relationship using the API:

Abbreviation | What it Represents
---|---
`AL `| All Types
`CR` | Carbon Rights
`CO` | Concessionary Rights
`CU` | Customary Rights
`EA` | Easement
`ES` | Equitable Servitude

### Delete a Relationship

```endpoint
DELETE /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/relationships/tenure/{relationship_id}/
```

Use the above method to delete a relationship from a project.

Pressing the **Delete** button from the API UI will delete the relationship between the party and the spatial unit.

![](_img/delete-tenure-relationship.png)

**Response**

> Oliver, not sure if this is what's supposed to happen, but this is what happened.

If the deletion has properly occurred, then you should get a message like the following:

```
NOT FOUND

The requested URL /api/v1/organizations/example-organization/projects/global-project/relationships/tenure/f2eq96ez7rnkucwz9sr4my9y/ was not found on this server.
```

Now, when you go to look at the relationships by either spatial unit or party, the two will not longer be linked.

Otherwise, you'll get an error message or one of these [common response codes](01-introduction.md#user-content-common-response-codes).

####Example Response

```
NOT FOUND

The requested URL /api/v1/organizations/example-organization/projects/global-project/relationships/tenure/f2eq96ez7rnkucwz9sr4my9y/ was not found on this server.
```
