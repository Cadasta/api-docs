## Spatial Units (a.k.a Project Locations)


Projects in the Cadasta Platform are spatial in nature â€“ collections of points, lines, and polygons representing areas where land rights documentation is happening. These points, lines, and polygons can be retrieved and modified using the Cadasta API.  

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#project-locations" target="_blank">Read more about Project Locations in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The endpoint you need to access JSON for spatial units / project locations starts like this:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/
```


A spatial unit / project location JSON object contains the following properties: 

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`type` | `String` | This field is automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` | A [GeoJSON represenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries) of the spatial unit's geometry. 
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID, defines the type of location it is (land `types`), and lists any attributes. (See  the `properties` table below for more information)

The `properties` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` |  A unique ID for the spatial unit
`type` | `String` | The type of spatial unit that it is, defined by the fields in your questionnaire. (See the land `types` table below )
`attributes` | `Object` | An array of different attributes for the property. 
`project` | `Object` | An object containing basic information about the project, and within that, the organization. This field will not be present when working with a list of spatial units, as with `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/`. See the `project` table below for more information.

The `project` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` | A unique ID for the project
`organization` | `Object` |  An object containing the organization `id`, `slug` and `name`. (See the `organization` table below.)
`name` | `String` | The name of the project that the spatial unit is a project. 
`slug` | `String` | The project slug.

Finally, the `organization` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` |  A unique ID for the organization.
`slug` | `String` |  The organization slug.
`name` | `String` |  The name of the organization that's housing the project. 

**Land `type` Abbreviations**

If you need to plot out the land `types`, these are the abbreviations you need:

Abbreviation | What it Represents
--- | ---
`PA` | Parcel
`CB` | Community Boundary
`BU` | Building
`AP` | Apartment
`PX` | Project Extent
`RW` | Right-of-way
`NP` | National Park Boundary
`MI` | Miscellaneous

### List Spatial Units / Project Locations

```endpoint
GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/
```

Use the above method to get the GPS coordinates for all of the locations in a spatial unit / project location. These coordinates may be shown as a point, line or polygon.


**URL Parameters**

URL Parameter | Description
---|---
`organization_slug` | The slug provided for the organization, which can be found by locating the organization in the [list of all organzations](03-organization.md#user-content-list-organizations)

## Parties

Each project location has a relationship with people of all kinds â€“Â sometimes individuals, sometimes groups, and sometimes a corporation. These people are known as **parties** in the Cadasta system. 

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#location-relationships" target="_blank">Read more about Parties in our Platform Documentation</a>_

Using the API, you can view, create, update, and delete parties for your project. 

The endpoint for parties begins like this:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/
```

A party JSON object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`id` | `String` | The autogenerated unique ID for each party.
`name` | `String` | The name of the party.
`type` | `String` | The type of party, indicating whether it's an individual (`IN`), a group (`GR`), or a corporation (`CO`).
`attributes` | `Object` | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the projects questionnaire. 
`project` | `Object` | A field with the project `id`, `name`, `slug`, and `organization`, which is itself an array including the organization `id`, `slug`, and `name`. (See the `project` and `organization` tables below for more information.) Note that this property will not appear in all responses. 

The `project` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` | A unique ID for the project
`organization` | `Array` | An object containing the organization `id`, `slug` and `name`. (See the `organization` table below.)
`name` | `String` | The name of the project that the spatial unit is a project. 
`slug` | `String` | The project slug.

Finally, the `organization` object contains the following properties:

Property | Type | Description
---|---|---
`id` | `String` |  A unique ID for the organization.
`slug` | `String` |  The organization slug.
`name` | `String` |  The name of the organization that's housing the project. 


#### Example Party JSON Object

```json
{
    "id": "z8f83bt6fskq6wcvnp223t3q",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "type": "IN",
    "attributes": {},

## Relationships

Each location has a relationship with one or more parties, and each of those parties has a specific type of relationship with the land. For example, a municipal body may own a park, and a local tribe may have right-of-way access to it. Ownership and right-of-way-access are both types of relationships. (Note that sometimes you may also see the word "tenure" in lieu of or alongside the word "relationship.")

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#location-relationships" target="_blank">Read more about Relationships in our Platform Documentation</a>_

The Cadasta API allows you to list relationships of a party and list relationships to a spatial unit / project location. You can also get, create, update, and delete relationships as well.

Endpoints in this section start with:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/parties/{party_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/spatial/{spatial_unit_id}/relationships/
```

or

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/relationships/tenure/{relationship_id}/
```

A relationship object contains the following properties:

The response is a an array of JSON Objects, each of which has the following properties:


Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`rel_class`| `String` | The type of relationships; currently `"tenure"` is the only possible relatioship type.
`id` | `String`  | The unique ID of the relationship
`party` | `Array` | The object containing the party that the spatial unit is related to. (See the `party` table below for more information.)
`spatial_unit` | `Object` | The spatial unit / project location object. (See the `spatial unit` table below for more information.)
`tenure_type`| `String` |  The kind of relationship. (See the [Relationship (Tenure) Categories table](#user-content-relationship-tenure-categories) for more information.)
`attributes`| `Object`  | Project-specific attributes that are defined through the project's questionnaire. 

The `party` object has the following properties: 

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`id` | `String` | The unique ID of the party. 
`name` | `String` | The name of the party.
`type` | `String` |  The type of party, e.g. an individual (`IN`), a group (`GR`), or a corporation (`CO`).

The `spatial_unit` object has the following properties:

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`type` | `String` | Type of spatial unit; automatically set to `Feature`.
`geometry` | `Object` |  A [GeoJSON represenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#Geometries) of the spatial unit's geometry.
`properties` | `Object` | An object that gives the location a unique ID and defines the type of location it is (land `types`). (See  the `properties` table below for more information)
