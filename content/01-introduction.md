## Cadasta API documentation

Welcome to the Cadasta API documentation! We're glad you found it. 

This documentation is intended for use alongside the Cadasta Platform API, which is a RESTful API using common HTTP methods. To access the API, visit:

This page uses Django REST Framework (a.k.a. DRF Docs) to show each data endpoint available, along with what kind of methods work with each endpoint. For example, `/api/v1/account/register` can use the POST method. 

### Using DRF Docs

To view the fields available for each node, click either "Options" or the node itself.
