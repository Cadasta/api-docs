## Project Resources

For any given project, there are lots of resources that may be collected: letters, deeds, photographs, audio recordings, etc. Using the Cadasta API, you can list all the resources connected to a specific project, as well as create, view, and update individual ones.

_<a href="https://docs.cadasta.org/en/04-records.html#project-resources" target="_blank">Read more about Project Resources in our Platform Documentation</a>_

To access project resources using the API, use the following endpoint:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/resources/
```

**Project Resource Object Properties**

Each project resource appears as a JSON object with the following properties:

Property | Type | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
`id` | `String` | A unique ID autmatically genereated for the file.
`name` | `String` | The name of the file (e.g. Deed of Trust)
`description` | `String` | A description of the file (e.g. The only deed we can find that has information relevant to the site.)
`file` | `String` | URL to a hosted version of the file, likely on an Amazon server or something similar.
`original_file` | `String` | Original file name (e.g. deed-of-trust.pdf).
`archived` | `Boolean` | Indicates whether the file has been archived or not.


#### Example Project Resource JSON Object

```json
{
	"id": "8u5dgnvgzix6kmg9hvbfdy3c",
	"name": "Deed",
	"description": "",
	"file": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cadasta-platformstaging-bucket/resources/wcajeysz7ngrae3bd84af99q.pdf",
